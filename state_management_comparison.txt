State Management Comparison: weather_bloc vs weather_riverpod

1. BLoC Implementation (weather_bloc)
--------------------------------
State Management Approach:
- Uses BLoC pattern with separate Event and State classes
- States are immutable and extend Equatable for comparison
- Multiple state classes for different scenarios:
  * WeatherInitial
  * WeatherLoading
  * WeatherLoaded
  * WeatherForecastLoaded
  * WeatherError
  * WeatherUnitsChanged

Complex State Handling:
- Uses copyWith pattern for state updates
- Maintains separate states for different features (weather, forecast, units)
- State transitions are explicit through events
- Uses bloc-to-bloc communication for location changes

Example of Complex State:
```dart
class WeatherLoaded extends WeatherState {
  final Weather weather;
  final List<ForecastDay>? forecast;

  const WeatherLoaded({required this.weather, this.forecast});

  @override
  List<Object> get props => [weather, if (forecast != null) forecast!];

  WeatherLoaded copyWith({Weather? weather, List<ForecastDay>? forecast}) {
    return WeatherLoaded(
      weather: weather ?? this.weather,
      forecast: forecast ?? this.forecast,
    );
  }
}
```

2. Riverpod Implementation (weather_riverpod)
--------------------------------
State Management Approach:
- Uses AsyncNotifierProvider for state management
- Combines multiple states into a single WeatherData class
- Handles loading, error, and data states through AsyncValue
- Uses ref.watch for reactive state updates

Complex State Handling:
- Encapsulates related data in a single class
- Uses AsyncValue for handling async states
- Combines current weather and forecast in one state
- Simpler state transitions through direct method calls

Example of Complex State:
```dart
class WeatherData {
  final Weather currentWeather;
  final List<ForecastDay> forecast;

  WeatherData({required this.currentWeather, required this.forecast});
}

final weatherProvider = AsyncNotifierProvider<WeatherNotifier, WeatherData?>(
  WeatherNotifier.new,
);
```

Key Differences:
1. State Organization:
   - BLoC: Multiple state classes for different scenarios
   - Riverpod: Single state class with AsyncValue wrapper

2. State Updates:
   - BLoC: Event-driven updates with explicit state transitions
   - Riverpod: Direct method calls with automatic state updates

3. Error Handling:
   - BLoC: Separate error states for different scenarios
   - Riverpod: Unified error handling through AsyncValue

4. State Access:
   - BLoC: Uses context.read() and BlocBuilder
   - Riverpod: Uses ref.watch() and ConsumerWidget

5. State Dependencies:
   - BLoC: Uses bloc-to-bloc communication
   - Riverpod: Uses provider dependencies through ref

Advantages of Each Approach:
BLoC:
- More explicit state transitions
- Better for complex state machines
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to track state changes

Riverpod:
- More concise code
- Simpler state management
- Better for reactive programming
- Easier to handle async states
- More flexible provider composition
