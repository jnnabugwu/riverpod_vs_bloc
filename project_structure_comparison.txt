Project Structure Comparison: weather_bloc vs weather_riverpod

1. Overall Project Structure
--------------------------------
Both projects follow standard Flutter project structure with similar platform-specific directories:
- android/
- ios/
- web/
- windows/
- linux/
- macos/
- build/
- .dart_tool/

Common configuration files:
- pubspec.yaml
- analysis_options.yaml
- .gitignore
- README.md
- .metadata
- .flutter-plugins
- .flutter-plugins-dependencies

2. Main Differences in `lib` Directory
--------------------------------
weather_bloc:
- Uses traditional Clean Architecture structure:
  - presentation/ (UI layer)
  - core/ (shared utilities and constants)
  - data/ (data sources and repositories)
  - domain/ (business logic and entities)

weather_riverpod:
- Uses Clean Architecture with additional layer:
  - application/ (state management layer with providers)
  - presentation/ (UI layer)
  - core/ (shared utilities and constants)
  - data/ (data sources and repositories)
  - domain/ (business logic and entities)

3. Test Directory Structure
--------------------------------
weather_bloc:
- presentation/ (test directory)
- widget_test.dart (basic implementation)

weather_riverpod:
- application/ (test directory for providers)
- widget_test.dart (more comprehensive implementation)

Key Observations:
1. The Riverpod version has an additional `application` layer that handles state management, which is a key architectural difference between the two implementations.
2. The test structure in Riverpod is more focused on testing the application layer (providers) compared to Bloc's focus on presentation layer testing.
3. Both maintain clean architecture principles but implement them slightly differently to accommodate their respective state management solutions.
